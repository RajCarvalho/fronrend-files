git hub is version control system  we use git hub to put our created files over the web siye git hub 

step 1:  i have a file on my desktop called move which i want to put over github
  so  in gitbash i go to

$cd Desktop/move

you initialize this by 
$git init

 so after this we will do $ls  to look for the files in our derectory                   cd add commit -m
$ls -la will show you the .git hidden file

now the next 2nd  big step is moving this files from working derectory to staging area 

 $git add education.html
$git status

will show education.html in green while all others in red

to put all in staging area
$git add .


now the 3 rd big step is commiting
$commit -m "you put your message here like initial rivision "

you can always check your status any time

ang git log shows all info

 working in stagin environment

git checkout is like undo in working derectory
git reset Head is undo like bringing back ile from staging area to working area
git rm myscript - not only deletes but aalso brings in staging
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
all you need to know 
cd mkdir pwd ls ls -la

1.git clone url                                           to copy someone elses repository on remote server to our local machine

2. git init
git remote add origin url
git add .
git commit -m "the first version"                         to load out repository from local machine to remote repositoty
  does both above(git commit -am "the first version)
git push origin master

git branching s very important part


git checkout filename   undo in working derectory

git reset Head  file name    undo from staging to working
git rm ""                 not only deletes but also makes accepy in staging

git init                initalizing
git add file.html      staging
git commit -m ""       commit the changes

git status                to check where file lie
git log                    to track commits 

 
git push                 to push n remote repository
git pull                 to get file from remote repository to  localcomputer

git merge                when conflicyts occur  and you need to merge code of two people


Branching one imp concept
  git branch                    shw branches
git branch alternate            creates branch alternate
git checkout alternate           helps swithing branch
git merege altername             combines twi branches

git branch -m aplernate alter       changes name of branch
git branch -d alternate             deletes branch named alternate
